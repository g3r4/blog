### 1. What is CO2 PPM?
PPM stands for Parts Per Million and those are the units we use to measure the concentration levels of Carbon Dioxide in the atmosphere.  PPM Usually describes the concentration of something in water or soil. One ppm is equivalent to 1 milligram of something per liter of water (mg/l) or 1 milligram of something per kilogram soil (mg/kg). The number you see in this blog is the weekly average CO2 concentration in our atmosphere. This data comes from an API that parses the official [RSS feed](http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/webdata/ccgg/trends/rss.xml) from the [NOAA/ESRL](https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/) (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration / Earth System Research Laboratory).

The actual measurement comes from Mauna Loa Observatory (MLO), an atmospheric station part of NOAA's Earth System Research Laboratory located on the Hawaiian volcano of Mauna Loa. Because this observatory is high up in the middle of the Pacific Ocean and is away from any sources on the ground, provides MLO a particular advantage when measuring CO2 levels. These levels have been recorded there since the 1950s.

### 2. CO2 Impact in Our Planet
Carbon Dioxide is a greenhouse gas. A greenhouse gas is a gas that absorbs or emits radiant energy, in the atmosphere, these gases do not let escape the energy and heat from the sun causing the entire planet to warm up. The primary greenhouse gases in Earth's atmosphere are water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and ozone. Without greenhouse gases, the average temperature of Earth's surface would be about −18 °C (0 °F), rather than the present average of 15 °C (59 °F).

Human activities since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution (around 1750) have produced a 45% increase in the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide (CO
2), from 280 ppm in 1750 to 406 ppm in early 2017.

At current emission rates, temperatures could increase by **2 °C**, which the United Nations' [IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change)](https://www.ipcc.ch/) designated as the upper limit to avoid **dangerous** levels.

### 3. Atmospheric Trends
At the time of writing this post (August 2019) these are the recorded levels and trends of CO2 in our atmosphere:

There is a correlation between these CO2 levels and the temperature increase measured at pre-industrial levels

What are the consequences of reaching a 4ºC temperature increase if we continue business as usual? Most projections show that in most cases, CO2 should exceed 500 ppm by the year 2050, if not sooner. That’s only 30 years away, a lot of these models do not consider the methane that is being released from permafrost and the devastating effects that this will have. A child born today will experience CO2 levels of 500 ppm when he or she is in their 30s or possibly even 20s. The hundred-point rise between 300 to 400 ppm took about a century; the rise between 400 to 500 ppm will take only about 30 years, and with accelerating rates, the rise to 600 ppm and eventually 900 ppm will happen even faster.

Drowned cities, stagnant seas, intolerable heatwaves, entire nations uninhabitable… and more than 11 billion humans. A four-degree-warmer world is the stuff of nightmares and yet that’s where we’re heading in just decades.

### 4. Biggest Contributors

![Where do Greenhouse Gas Emissions Come From?](./uc_climatechange_illustrations_greenhouse-gas-emissions.png "Where do Greenhouse Gas Emissions Come From?")

Even though animal agriculture is not the top greenhouse gas contributor, it has many other side effects that make this the cruelest and most destructive force in our planet today:

By causing deforestation (about 91% of Amazon's destruction), our planet's natural capacity to capture CO2 from the atmosphere with trees is diminished. Animal agriculture produces huge amounts of Methane which is 40 times more powerful than CO2 to capture heat and it also consumes insane amounts of fresh water. Another issue that is often overlooked is the cruelty in which this industry is allowed to operate. However, this is an extensive topic for another post.

### 5. Ok, How Much Is Too Much Then?
We are currently at the safe top limit of CO2 in our atmosphere, We've already warmed the Earth by 1.5ºC and some irreversible tipping points have already been reached, like the massive loss of ice sheet all around the planet. Even though some of these effects are not reversible, we are still at a point where we can avoid catastrophic damage. If we get to 4ºC or about 700 CO2 ppm (which is the current trend and estimate within a few decades) we will experience disastrous collapse of major ecosystems and a huge and irreversible impact to human civilization.


### 6. Individual actions you can do now to reduce your carbon footprint
There are many things a person can do to help preserve our ecosystems and fight climate change. You will also hear from many people that individual action is so small that doing nothing is the same thing. In my opinion, this reasoning is wrong, this is often just a way to justify complete inaction and business as usual practices that will continue to deteriorate the planet to support human civilization, doing nothing and justifying it like that is the easy thing to do. 

I fully understand that reducing your carbon footprint individually is not enough, there are many industries that add excessive amounts of CO2 to the atmosphere. However, this is all about creating a global culture that can foster more people joining the fight so we can collectively demand government action and regulation to reduce and eliminate emissions, it is very important that we also get involved in political movements that promote cleaner and renewable alternatives and that we also elect representatives that care about these issues.

If for some reason after reading all this you are eager to start doing something, here are some initial ideas to get you started:

|   | Action | Impact |
| -- | ---------- | ---------- |
| 1 | Reduce or eliminate your meat consumption | Highest |
| 2 | Buy locally as much as you can | High |
| 3 | Reduce your AC and heating energy consumption | High |
| 4 | Reduce, repair and reuse before recycle | High |
| 5 | Ride your bike to work if possible or use public transportation instead of a car | Med to High (depending on distance) |
| 6 | [Offset your carbon emissions](https://offset.climateneutralnow.org/) | High |

We will explore more actions we all can do to continue fighting climate change in future posts, is never too late to start, be consistent and try to add more and more actions as days go by, this planet is our only home, let's help clean up the mess.
