### 1. What is CO2 PPM?
PPM stands for Parts Per Million and those are the units we use to meassure the concentration levels of Carbon Dioxide in the atmosphere.  PPM Usually describes the concentration of something in water or soil. One ppm is equivalent to 1 milligram of something per liter of water (mg/l) or 1 milligram of something per kilogram soil (mg/kg). The number you see in this blog, is the weekly average CO2 concentration in our atmosphere. This data comes from an API that parses the official [RSS feed](http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/webdata/ccgg/trends/rss.xml) from the [NOAA/ESRL](https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/) (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration / Earth System Research Laboratory).

The actual meassurement comes from Mauna Loa Observatory (MLO), an atmospheric station part of NOAA's Earth System Research Laboratory located on the Hawaiian volcano of Mauna Loa. Because this observatory is high up in the middle of the Pacific Ocean and is away from any sources on the ground, provides MLO a particular advantage when measuring CO2 levels. These levels have been recorded there since the 1950s.

### 2. CO2 Impact in Our Planet
Carbon Dioxide is a greenhouse gas. A greenhouse gas is a gas that absorbs or emits radiant energy, in the atmosphere, these gases do not let escape the energy and heat from the sun causing the entire planet to warm up. The primary greenhouse gases in Earth's atmosphere are water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and ozone. Without greenhouse gases, the average temperature of Earth's surface would be about −18 °C (0 °F), rather than the present average of 15 °C (59 °F).

Human activities since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution (around 1750) have produced a 45% increase in the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide (CO
2), from 280 ppm in 1750 to 406 ppm in early 2017.

At current emission rates, temperatures could increase by **2 °C**, which the United Nations' [IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change)](https://www.ipcc.ch/) designated as the upper limit to avoid **dangerous** levels.

### 3. Atmosferic Trends
At the time of writing this post (August 2019) these are the recorded levels and trends of CO2 in our atmosphere:
