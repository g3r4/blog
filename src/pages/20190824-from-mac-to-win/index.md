For a long time, Apple MacBook Pros have been the tool of choice for modern web developers, altough I have to admit, I have seen in my carreer several developers using Windows computers as well with stacks like xaamp and the likes, I won't get into that discussion and into that rabbit hole but One of the things that made Apple very successful with developers and in particular web developers is that Mac OSX is a UNIX based system and we get all the fun and cool stuff that we also run in our servers.

Another thing to consider is that I believe that Apple has a very good quality assurance process with their equipment, and for a long time in the Windows laptop realm, it has been hit and miss.

The option we were left with was to purchase one of these windows laptops and install linux on them, (and yes, we've had linux cetified laptop computers for a while) and while I have tried this alternative myself in the past, it has never been a clean experience, interface issues, graphic issues, and driver problems have been an issue with linux and the diversity of equipment you could buy, the linux experience gets better and better everyday Distributions like Ununtu, linux mint (add others) and others bring Linux closer and closer to mass consumers everyday.

### Why did I consider the switch

That is Apple tag line during 1993, I found an [interesting article analizing this on Business Insider that explores the topic a bit more](https://www.businessinsider.com/old-apple-ads-compared-to-modern-apple-2018-11#it-eventually-started-to-distance-itself-from-the-business-market-or-at-least-appeal-to-a-non-business-crowd-with-its-get-a-mac-campaign-starting-in-2006-4). Howerver to me, when I read that and try to apply in 2019 it does not make sense, here a quick example for a couple of configurations using the latest apple macbook and the latest model for the Lenovo thinkpad P52:

Why Lenovo Thinkpad?

A few other things to have in mind, if you need to upgrade anything on the MacBook pro you are out of luck, however if you need an additional hard drive, more ram memory or a brand new battery, those are all things you can do with a thinkpad.
