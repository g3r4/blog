Like many of us, I've been trying to start a blog where I can share things I think could be useful (or entertaining) for someone out there. This is, after many trials and different technologies and approaches I've tried in the past, another one to implement something I feel inspired and engaged about to write and share words with whoever is interested to read them.

If you are wondering what kind of stuff you will find here, I will use this space to share thoughts, opinions and tips about things I've found useful and rightful over the course of my life. I am very passionate about technology in general and all topics around climate change.


**> git revert EARTH** is a play of words on an actual [git command](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-revert) 
```
git revert HEAD~3
```
From the official git documentation:

>Given one or more existing commits, revert the changes that the related patches introduce, and record some new commits that record them. This requires your working tree to be clean (no modifications from the `HEAD` commit).
>
>Note: git revert is used to record some new commits to reverse the effect of some earlier commits (often only a faulty one). If you want to throw away all uncommitted changes in your working directory, you should see `git reset`[1], particularly the `--hard` option. If you want to extract specific files as they were in another commit, you should see `git checkout`[1], specifically the `git checkout <commit> -- <filename>` syntax. Take care with these alternatives as both will discard uncommitted changes in your working directory.

For the purpose of this blog, I would love to translate that previous description like this:

_Given one or more existing **human induced climate alterations**, revert the changes that the related **decisions** introduce, and record **the actions** that **aliviate** them. This **also requires consistent individual and collective clean action** (no **reset and forget**)._

_Note: git revert **EARTH** is used to record some new **actions** to reverse the effect of some earlier **decisions** (often only a faulty one). If you want to throw away all **your will to change** in your (still) working **planet**, you should see `git i-don't-care`[1], particularly the `--hard` option. If you want to **perform only** specific **and easy actions** as they were in another **parts of your life**, you should see `git only-the-easy-things`[1], specifically the `git only-the-easy-things <no-straws> -- <plastic>` syntax. Take care with these alternatives as both will discard **collective action and desperately needed change** in your (still) working **planet**._
