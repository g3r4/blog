spoiler: All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us.

If you enjoy reading about technology and climate change, you are in the right place! I am very passionate about everything that surrounds those topics and I will try my best to develop content and write about things that can potentially be useful or interesting to you.

**> git revert EARTH** is a play of words on an actual [git command](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-revert) 
```
git revert HEAD~3
```
From the official git documentation:

>Given one or more existing commits, revert the changes that the related patches introduce, and record some new commits that record them. This requires your working tree to be clean (no modifications from the `HEAD` commit).
>
>Note: git revert is used to record some new commits to reverse the effect of some earlier commits (often only a faulty one). If you want to throw away all uncommitted changes in your working directory, you should see `git reset`[1], particularly the `--hard` option. If you want to extract specific files as they were in another commit, you should see `git checkout`[1], specifically the `git checkout <commit> -- <filename>` syntax. Take care with these alternatives as both will discard uncommitted changes in your working directory.

For the purpose of this blog, allow me to change that previous reference into something like this:

_Given one or more existing **human induced climate alterations**, revert the changes that the related **decisions** introduce, and record **the actions** that **aliviate** them. This **also requires consistent individual and collective clean action** (no **reset and forget**)._

_Note: git revert **EARTH** is used to record some new **actions** to reverse the effect of some earlier **decisions** (often only a faulty one). If you want to throw away all **your will to change** in your (still) working **planet**, you should see `git i-don't-care`[1], particularly the `--hard` option. If you want to **perform only** specific **and easy actions** as they were in another **parts of your life**, you should see `git only-the-easy-things`[1], specifically the `git only-the-easy-things <no-straws> -- <plastic>` syntax. Take care with these alternatives as both will discard **collective action and desperately needed change** in your (still) working **planet**._
